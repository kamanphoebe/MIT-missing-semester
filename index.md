I've taken a MIT open course called "[The Missing Semester of Your CS Education(2020)](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)" in 2021. Here are my solutions for some of the exercises. There are a few of them haven't completely solved yet because of errors or some other problems. So please feel to send me a pull request if you have any suggestion or discover any fault for my solutions :) 

P.S. I'm using Ubuntu 18.04.5 at that time.
