# Lecture1: Course overview + the shell

1. **For this course, you need to be using a Unix shell like Bash or ZSH. If you
are on Linux or macOS, you don't have to do anything special. If you are on
Windows, you need to make sure you are not running cmd.exe or PowerShell;
you can use [Windows Subsystem for
Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) or a Linux virtual
machine to use Unix-style command-line tools. To make sure you're running
an appropriate shell, you can try the command `echo $SHELL`. If it says
something like `/bin/bash` or `/usr/bin/zsh`, that means you're running the
right program.**\

\
2. **Create a new directory called `missing` under `/tmp`.**
```
cd /tmp
mkdir missing
```
\
3. **Look up the `touch` program. The `man` program is your friend.**\
(Omit)\
\
4. **Use touch to create a new file called `semester` in `missing`.**
```
cd /tmp/missing
touch semester
```
\
5. **Write the following into that file, one line at a time:
```
#!/bin/sh
curl --head --silent https://missing.csail.mit.edu
```
The first line might be tricky to get working. It's helpful to know that
`#` starts a comment in Bash, and `!` has a special meaning even within
double-quoted (`"`) strings. Bash treats single-quoted strings (`'`)
differently: they will do the trick in this case. See the Bash
[quoting](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Quoting.html)
manual page for more information.**
```
echo '#!/bin/sh' > semester
echo 'curl --head --silent https://missing.csail.mit.edu' >> semester
```
\
6. **Try to execute the file, i.e. type the path to the script (`./semester`)
into your shell and press enter. Understand why it doesn't work by
consulting the output of `ls` (hint: look at the permission bits of the
file).**
Use `ls -l semester` command can find the file's permission bits are `rw-r--r--`
and that's why it can't be executed.
\
7. **Run the command by explicitly starting the `sh` interpreter, and giving it
the file `semester` as the first argument, i.e. `sh semester`. Why does
this work, while `./semester` didn't?**
The `sh` interpreter interprets `semester` instead of running it directly which needs permissions.
\
8. **Look up the `chmod` program (e.g. use `man chmod`).**\
(Omit)\
\
9. **Use `chmod` to make it possible to run the command `./semester` rather than
having to type `sh semester`. How does your shell know that the file is
supposed to be interpreted using `sh`? See this page on the
[shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) line for more
information.**
```
chmod +x semester
```
The first line of `semester` which called `shebang` line tells bash which interpreter to use.\
\
10. **Use `|` and `>` to write the "last modified" date output by
`semester` into a file called `last-modified.txt` in your home
directory.**
```
./semester | head -n 4 | tail -n 1 > ~/last-modified.txt
# or
sh semester | head -4 | tail +4 > ~/last-modified.txt
# or
./semester | sed -ne '{4,4p}' > ~/last-modified.txt
```
\
11. ***Write a command that reads out your laptop battery's power level or your
desktop machine's CPU temperature from `/sys`. Note: if you're a macOS
user, your OS doesn't have sysfs, so you can skip this exercise.***
```
# I found a path that seems to be correct
# but there is no file about battery's power level
cd /sys/class/power_supply/ACAD/power
```
